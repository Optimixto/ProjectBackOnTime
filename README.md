# ProjectBackOnTime

End-Of-Degree Project
Alejandro García Muñoz

Back On Time is a Unity-developed project that showcases the story of Laura, a spy-for-hire with the ability to control time.

Our objective is to reach the end of the level, while avoiding being caught.

The control scheme can be found in the pause menu (Start/ESC).

Thanks for trying Back On Time.
